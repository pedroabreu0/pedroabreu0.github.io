title: A little more about myself
permalink: /misc/
---

I was born in the small town of Silvânia - Goiás, in Brazil.

My father was a renouned lawyer, whom which I enherit the name.

My mom always believed in me since a young age, I probably wouldn't speak
english if she wasn't a firm believer that it would be important for my future
(and my brother's).

I've loved videogames since a young age, and my favorite game of all
times is Chrono Trigger. Ironically I'm not super into open world games (and
that includes Zelda). I've played a lot of Lineage II in my teens and before
moving to the US (good times!).

I'm a Blue Belt in Taekwondo. My record mounting the rubik's cube is around
10s, but nowadays I probably take more like 1min. I've spent some time
learning how to cook, so much enough that I have dedicated an instagram page
for that. Ironically I don't love travelling so much. I'm a Spiritist since a
young age, but nowadays I think I resonate more with Umbanda (but really my
faith quite ecumenic, and the Hermetic Kaballah is the backbone of my
spiritual belief system).  I have a strong meditation practice that is
mostly centered around visualization and contemplation. Turns out that
"emptying the mind" is just the tip of the iceberg.

When I look around the amazing peers I have it is hard for me to not feel
like an impostor sometimes. But I try to focus on me and on my unique gifts.
I believe that we are all unique and talented in different ways, but we still
have to water those seeds daily and dilligently.
