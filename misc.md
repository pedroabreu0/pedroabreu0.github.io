Pedro Abreu is a spark of awareness that has cristalized into a
discriminative rational module often denominated as Ego, but _I_ prefer
the hebrew tradition denomination Ruach.

I'm originally a [Spiritist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism),
and although that stil serves me as a good base, recently I'm more interested
in the western tradition of Magic as a whole. This includes meditation,
Kaballah, Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy and all that.

Wandered, lost in the dark regions of the human psyche. Through the depths of
unkonwn materiality we now stand firmly with our courage between the sharp
sword of wind and the sweet chalice of our own blood. 

Inexorably, the light shall prevail.
