title: A little more about myself
permalink: /misc/
---

I was born in the small town of Silvânia, Goiás, in Brazil, on May 8, 1993.

My father was a renowned lawyer in this small town, from whom I inherited the name.

My mom always believed in me from a young age. I probably wouldn't speak
English if she hadn’t been a firm believer that it would be important for my future
and my brother's.

I've loved video games since a young age, and my favorite game of all
time is *Chrono Trigger*. Ironically, I'm not super into open-world
video games, and that includes *Zelda*. I've played a lot of *Lineage II* in my
teens and before moving to the US. Good times!

Since I was a small child, I would say that I wanted to work with computers—it has
always been my passion. As a teenager, I would spend a lot of time trying to
hack *Grand Chase* or program certain bots. When I was about to choose my
college course, I had to decide between Computer Science or Computer
Engineering. Thankfully, I chose CS because otherwise, I would possibly never
have discovered the beautiful paradise of *Cantor, Gödel, Turing, Alonzo Church*, and
*Martin-Löf*. I fell in love with mathematical formalism in the course of Number
Theory and have never stopped learning and working with the beautiful world of
mathematical proofs ever since.

I'm a Blue Belt in Taekwondo. My PR solving the Rubik's Cube is around
10 seconds, but nowadays, I probably take more like 1 minute. I've spent some time
learning how to cook—enough that I dedicated an Instagram page
to it. Ironically, I don't love traveling so much. I've been a Spiritist since a
young age, but nowadays, I think I resonate more with Umbanda. However, my
faith is quite ecumenical, and the Hermetic Kabbalah is the backbone of my
spiritual belief system. I also have a strong meditation practice that is
mostly centered around visualization and contemplation. It turns out that
"emptying the mind" is just the tip of the iceberg.

When I look around at the amazing peers I have, it's hard for me not to feel
like an impostor sometimes. But I try to focus on myself and my unique gifts.
I believe that we are all unique and talented in different ways, but we still
have to water those seeds daily and diligently.
