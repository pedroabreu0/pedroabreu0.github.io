I am currently a PhD student at Purdue University. I work with Programming Languages,
Proofs and Theorem Provers.

My advisor is [Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/).

Right now I am an intern at [Sifive](https://www.sifive.com/) under 
[Murali Vijayaraghavan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vmurali/). We are formalizing
the floating point unit using [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
and [Kami](http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/).

I got my BS in Computer Science at the University of Brasilia, under 
[Rodrigo Bonifacio](http://wp.rbonifacio.net/) in 2017.

The picture above was taken at the University of Sydney, where I was part of the study
abroad program Ciência Sem Fronteiras in 2014.
