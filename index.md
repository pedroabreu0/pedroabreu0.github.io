Host of the [Type Theory Forall Podcast](https://www.typetheoryforall.com/)

I have a MsC at Purdue University under [Prof. Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/). My work was in Programming Languages,
Proofs and Theorem Provers, more specifically, translating GADTs from OCaml to Coq for [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/clarus/coq-of-ocaml), this work was partially funded by [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com/).


The summer of '19 I have been an intern at [Galois Inc.](https://galois.com/)

In 2018 I was an intern at [Sifive](https://www.sifive.com/) under 
[Murali Vijayaraghavan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vmurali/). Worked on the formalization
of the floating point unit using [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
and [Kami](http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/).

I got my BS in Computer Science at the University of Brasilia, under 
[Prof. Rodrigo Bonifacio](https://rbonifacio.github.io/) in 2017.
