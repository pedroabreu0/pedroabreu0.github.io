I am currently a PhD student at Purdue University. I work with Programming Languages,
Proofs and Theorem Provers. More specifically on
[Coquedille](https://github.com/pedrotst/coquedille), a
compiler from the intrinsic type theory of Coq to the extrinsic type theory of
Cedille.

Host of the [Type Theory Forall Podcast](https://www.typetheoryforall.com/)

My advisor is [Prof. Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/).

The summer of '20 I was an intern at [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com/),
translating Gadts from OCaml to coq for [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/clarus/coq-of-ocaml).

The summer of '19 I have been an intern at [Galois Inc.](https://galois.com/)

Before starting my PhD in '18 I was an intern at [Sifive](https://www.sifive.com/) under 
[Murali Vijayaraghavan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vmurali/). Worked on the formalization
of the floating point unit using [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
and [Kami](http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/).

I got my BS in Computer Science at the University of Brasilia, under 
[Rodrigo Bonifacio](https://rbonifacio.github.io/) in 2017.
