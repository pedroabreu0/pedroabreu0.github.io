# Finding Purpose Through Pain: A Journey from Suffering to Service

Suffering has walked beside me for as long as I can remember.\
When I was nine, my father died in a catastrophic way that changed the
course of my life. It left a wound that would take years to even begin
to understand. Ever since, pain is the silent undercurrent of my
own story.

As I've learned to live with it, not as an enemy, not as something
to overcome, but as a teacher. Pain has been, in a strange way, a guide
--- a rough, uncompromising mirror that shows me when I stray too far
from what is true.

I don't believe suffering is noble, or necessary, or fair. But I've
learned that when I face it honestly, to differentiate pain from suffering.
Then it can become a source of clarity. And, of great purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Weight of the Ivory Tower

Years later, when I entered academia, I found myself surrounded by
another kind of suffering --- quieter, more socially acceptable, but
just as real.

I've watched people with extraordinary minds break under pressure. I've
seen the exhaustion that hides behind polite conference smiles. Burnout
isn't an exception in academia; it's often the norm.

The structure itself seems built to test the limits of endurance: the
endless stream of teaching, research, publishing, grant-writing,
grading. And all of it under the humble title of *student* --- as if
that word were meant to justify the lack of recognition, the low pay,
the uncertain future.

It's a strange contradiction: academia attracts those who love knowledge
for its own sake, yet it traps them in a system that often values
production over understanding. You can be contributing to humanity's
intellectual frontier and still be told you're not doing enough.

I've seen how easily rigor can slip into cruelty, how ambition can turn
into exploitation. Advisors can become gatekeepers, mentors can become
tyrants. The film *Whiplash* captured it almost too perfectly --- the
belief that greatness is worth breaking people for. I've watched
versions of that story unfold in real life, and the scars it leaves
behind are deep.

And yet, I've also been incredibly fortunate. My own advisors and
mentors have been remarkable sources of kindness and guidance. They've
challenged me, yes, but they've also protected me when I most needed it.
I carry immense gratitude for that. Not everyone in academia is cruel
--- some are the very reason many of us survive it at all.

But it's impossible to ignore that for many, the experience is far
harsher. The system rewards those who push and punishes those who pause
to breathe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Invisible Struggles of International Students

For international students, the burden multiplies. You live between
worlds, never fully belonging to either. You speak in a second language,
think in two cultures, and constantly translate yourself to fit in.

You miss birthdays, weddings, funerals --- the rhythm of family life
that continues without you. You watch your loved ones age through
screens, their laughter echoing from another world. You promise yourself
it's temporary, but the years go by and the distance becomes part of
you.

And all the while, you are measured by the same yardstick as those who
sleep in their own beds, who have family dinners on weekends, who don't
have to navigate visa rules or time zones or loneliness.

Some international students go half a decade or more without returning
home. Not because they don't want to, but because the immigration system
turns love into a logistical impossibility.

I've seen them break quietly, behind closed doors, because there's no
room for fragility in a system that worships productivity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Cruelty of the System

Perhaps this cruelty begins much higher up. Professors, too, are trapped
--- bound by the relentless demands of tenure, funding, and prestige.
The culture of "publish or perish" devours empathy. Time becomes
currency, and mentorship becomes a transaction.

Under such pressure, the human dimension fades. A student's worth is
measured by their output, their grant potential, their ability to make
their advisor's lab shine.

Misogyny and discrimination remain. So do the politics of credit and the
quiet favoritism that shapes careers. I've seen advisors leave
institutions mid-PhD, leaving their students adrift. I've seen others
fall ill, their absence creating a vacuum of fear and uncertainty.

And then came COVID. The already fragile ecosystem cracked. Labs closed,
communities dissolved, and the isolation deepened. The world stopped,
but academia didn't --- it merely shifted its demands online, pretending
that intellectual life could go on untouched.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Watching People Fall

Over the years, I've seen too many brilliant people lose themselves in
this system.\
Some left academia entirely, reclaiming their sanity and their sleep.
Others stayed, hollowed out, running on fumes and fear.

Many of them had entered the field with the purest intentions ---
curiosity, passion, love of discovery. But the institution doesn't care
about purity of motive. It grinds everyone equally.

It's heartbreaking to watch friends who once spoke with wonder about
their research now speak only in metrics --- impact factors, h-indexes,
citation counts. You can almost see the light dimming.

And yet, the saddest part is that this is not an individual failure.
It's a systemic one. Academia is built on the myth that suffering is the
price of greatness. That to contribute to truth, you must first destroy
yourself.

But I've learned that the pursuit of truth without care for the seeker
is a hollow pursuit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Professor Who Didn't Care

I've seen professors who cared only for their work, not for their
students.\
A single careless comment can extinguish years of curiosity. A
dismissive attitude can turn a lifelong passion into a quiet resentment.

For a long time, I believed that hell must have a special place for such
people --- those who destroy the joy of learning in others.

But I've softened. I no longer see it in such moral terms. People
reproduce what they've known. Many of those harsh mentors were
themselves shaped by cruelty. They were told that the only way to forge
brilliance was through pain. They learned to mistake fear for
motivation.

That doesn't excuse the damage, but it explains its endurance. It's a
cycle --- and cycles can only be broken when we understand them from
within.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Crossing to the Other Side

At some point, I realized that I couldn't keep lamenting the system
without examining my own participation in it. Every frustration I voiced
was also a reflection of something within me --- my own wounds, my own
expectations.

The outer world mirrors the inner. And if I wanted to change anything, I
had to start there.

So I began to dig. Deeply. Into my patterns, my reactions, my pain. And
what I found at the bottom wasn't resignation --- it was tenderness. A
strange, fragile love that seemed to say: *this too is part of the
path*.

It became clear that the problems that haunted me most in academia were
not random. They resonated with something personal, something ancient.
They were connected to my own story of loss and striving, and to a
deeper flame that burns for truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My Life's Compass: Truth

If there is one thread that ties everything in my life together, it's
the pursuit of truth.

It's what drew me to science, to philosophy, to the formal languages
that try to make the world precise. Truth has always been my compass ---
elusive, abstract, and yet utterly necessary.

I often think of myself as a traveler at sea. Some sail the sea in search of
gold; I sail life in search of truth.

And the irony, of course, is that I don't even know what truth *is*.
Maybe it's not a destination, but a direction --- something we align
ourselves with moment by moment.

Each person has their own version of it, shaped by a lifetime of
experiences, traumas, loves, and fears. But not only by their own life
--- by the lives of those who came before.

Our ancestors live within us, encoded in our cells and our stories.
Their struggles, choices, and hopes ripple through time, shaping the
architecture of our perception. We are not isolated minds; we are
continuations.

To understand someone's truth, you have to understand their entire
lineage --- the visible and the invisible forces that made them who they
are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Burnout as a Signal

My burnout was not a transformation so much as a revelation.

It didn't destroy me. It exposed me. It forced me to listen to what my
body and psyche had been trying to say for years: *We went too far from
our truth.*

It's not about writing a new story. It's about hearing where the current
one went off course --- where we started living out of alignment with
what matters.

Burnout is the body's way of saying no when the mind refuses to. It's
not failure; it's feedback. A violent, undeniable message that something
fundamental needs attention.

For me, that message was clear: I had built my identity on achievement,
on usefulness, on being "enough" for a system that would never be
satisfied. And in doing so, I had neglected the deeper voice inside ---
the one that simply wanted to be whole.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Finding Meaning in Suffering

When I began to see suffering as communication rather than condemnation,
everything shifted.

Pain became a form of intelligence --- a message pointing toward what
really mattered for me.

Meaning isn't found in escaping pain but in understanding it. In asking
what it's trying to show us. What really matters to us.

I help others who are going through similar struggles — the exhausted students,
the disillusioned researchers, the ones questioning their worth — because I’ve
decided that this is how my suffering finds meaning.

If I can use what I’ve been through to help someone else avoid or move through
their own pain, then my suffering serves a purpose. It becomes more than an
accident; it becomes an offering.

Each time I listen, each time I extend a hand, I’m reshaping what hurt me into
something that heals. Helping people is not charity, and it’s not self-sacrifice
— it’s a conscious act of transformation. It’s the process of turning pain into
understanding, and understanding into compassion.

This week, for example, I made time to meet with a PhD student who was clearly
trapped in a toxic situation. At the end of our talk he thanked me, almost with
disbelief: “You are so kind, Pedro.” I don’t think of myself as kind. Don’t you
see? You are part of me. Your suffering is the echo of my own — only displaced
in time. When I help you, I am really helping the version of myself that once
didn’t know the way out.

And maybe, if I help you, you will help the next one. Maybe that’s how things
slowly get better — one person carrying another a few steps further down the
path. The film Pay It Forward couldn’t have captured it more accurately.

If my experiences can ease even a fraction of another person’s burden, then they
are doing their work in the world. Through helping others, my suffering
continues to evolve — it becomes alive, purposeful, and quietly redemptive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Mission: Making Academia a Little Better

I can't fix academia. No one can. But I can try to make it a little more
humane.

A little more forgiving, a little more aware of the fact that behind
every paper, every grant, every line of code, there's a human being
trying their best to stay afloat.

Academia is, at its heart, a collective pursuit of truth. But truth
divorced from care becomes sterile. Science isn't just about knowledge;
it's about people --- the fragile, complex creatures who carry that
knowledge forward.

If we crush those people, the entire enterprise collapses.

So I've made it my mission --- my small, stubborn mission --- to tend to
the human side of academia. To be the kind of presence I wish more
students had. To remind us that curiosity can coexist with kindness, and
that rigor does not require cruelty.

If I can make one student feel less alone, one researcher remember why
they started, that's enough.

That means the pain wasn't wasted. It means it became service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Choosing Compassion

People often say that suffering makes you compassionate. I don't think
it does.

Suffering offers the *possibility* of compassion --- but it can also
make you bitter, resentful, closed.

What matters is what you choose to do with it.

You can let pain harden you, or you can let it carve you open. You can
pass on your wounds, or you can decide that they end with you.

Turning suffering into compassion is an active choice. It's work. It's
the daily decision to transform anger into understanding, despair into
tenderness.

Healing doesn't mean forgetting. It means refusing to weaponize your
pain. It means using it as fuel for presence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Other Side of the Tunnel

I didn't escape the darkness. I learned to walk within it differently.

The light at the end of the tunnel wasn't waiting for me --- I had to
build it, slowly, from the inside out.

And now, when suffering returns --- as it always does, in new disguises
--- I recognize it. I know it's not here to destroy me, but to remind me
of my direction.

Pain remains a teacher, though I no longer mistake it for truth itself.
It's the echo that tells me where I've strayed, and where to return.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Thoughts

If you are in the midst of your own storm, I won't tell you that
everything happens for a reason. Some pain will never make sense.

But meaning can still be made from it.

Suffering doesn't automatically ennoble us. It tests us. It gives us the
raw material to choose who we will become.

For me, that choice has become clear: to serve. To help others carry
what I once carried alone. To make the spaces I inhabit --- especially
academia --- a little gentler, a little truer.

Because if my suffering can ease even a fraction of someone else's, then
it wasn't in vain.

And perhaps that is all purpose really is --- not a grand revelation,
but a quiet devotion: to keep turning pain into light, again and again.
