I’ve always been curious. That’s the heart of it. I want to understand how the
universe works — from the bending of fabrics of space-time to the workings of
our own minds. That’s what drew me to science. But that same curiosity, that
same longing to understand reality and ourselves, also led me deep into the
world of religion and spirituality.

To many in the scientific community, this might sound like a contradiction. In
fact, I’ve often felt a certain snobbery — a kind of proud mockery — from some
of my peers whenever spirituality comes up. And to be fair, I understand where
that reaction comes from. Science has had to fight long and hard against dogma
and misinformation. We've all seen spiritual communities that reject evolution,
deny vaccines, or claim the Earth is flat. And history is littered with
religious institutions abusing power — from the Crusades to modern-day cults.

But those failures — of institutions, not of spirituality itself — don’t justify
dismissing the entire spiritual endeavor. To frown upon spirituality is to
reject a profound and ancient part of the human experience. Whether or not you
believe in God, it’s not an accident that the Bible is considered by many to be
the most influential book in human history. Religion is not just a system of
beliefs — it’s a repository of human attempts to make sense of suffering,
meaning, morality, and the transcendent.

What many in science fail to see is that true spirituality has little to do with
blindly following a priest or guru. In fact, I’d argue that the real spiritual
path is a deeply personal and experimental process — much like science itself.
It involves reflection, discipline, and methods aimed at transforming our
perception of reality. These methods may include meditation, prayer, rituals,
and sometimes even the careful, respectful use of substances that alter
consciousness.

I’m not just speaking in abstractions here. My own path has taken me through a
wide array of spiritual traditions and practices:
- I’ve sat in 10-day silent Vipassana retreats;
- I’ve consecrated Ayahuasca with native communities;
- I've joined secret orders;
- I’ve studied and practiced Spiritism, Umbanda, Quimbanda, Candomblé, and Voodoo;
- I was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church, explored Adventism, Mormonism, and various branches of Protestantism;
- I’ve read the Stoics, Leibniz’s Theodicy, and The Brothers Karamazov;

These experiences weren’t about joining a religion. They were about exploring
consciousness — the most immediate and yet most mysterious aspect of reality.
They’ve offered me insights, not just into myself, but into the nature of being,
connection, and existence itself.

Ironically, I’ve often found more honest, childlike curiosity in spiritual
seekers than in academic circles. Academia, for all its brilliance, has grown
dry and mechanical. Overburdened by grants, bureaucracy, and performance
metrics, it’s lost some of the wonder that shone in the eyes of the scientific
pioneers — those who once looked at the night sky and asked “Why?”

The philosopher and physicist Richard Feynman once said:

> I don’t have to know an answer. I don’t feel frightened not knowing
> things... I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to
> have answers that might be wrong.

And yet, many of today’s self-proclaimed scientists seem terrified of not
knowing — especially when it comes to questions science was never meant to
answer. They cling to certainty and posture over mystery, hiding their
insecurity behind the cold altar of rationality. In their zeal to appear
objective, they’ve begun worshipping a new deity: their newly erected god now
named The Scientific Method.

But Feynman understood the limits of that god. He was clear — painfully clear —
that moral questions are not within the domain of science. How to live, how to
treat others, how to suffer well, how to face death — these are not equations to
be solved. They are spiritual, philosophical, existential questions. And
pretending they can be resolved with peer review and p-values is not only naive,
it’s intellectually dishonest.

In his own words, science is about what is, not what ought to be. It can tell
you how to split the atom — but not whether you should. It can explain the
chemistry of love — but not how to be a loving partner. And yet, many scientists
today dismiss entire traditions that have wrestled with those questions for
millennia. In doing so, they amputate one half of the human experience.

So when I turn to religion, I’m not rejecting science. I’m completing it.
